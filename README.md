# paralel_rezistance

Hi. So you no when you are calculating electric circuits and denote paralel resistance like R1||R2||R3  and so on.
And at the end you neet to calculate it sepretly befor pluging everything in to calculator,

With this program you can calculate it easy and quick.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

par.c  : c source file
rpar   : binary file compiled with gcc on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.06 LTS

# If you are using linux 

just copy binary file to your bin/ ( I prefere ~/.local/bin ) folder make it executable and you are redy to go.
or you can compile source yourselfe.

Then open the terminal, 

type 

`rpar R1 R2 R3 and so on`

hit enter and there is your result.

it doesent exept prefixes

# for any other system you will need to compile source and run it your self
